# Attendio
A serverless app that makes taking attendance with Google Sheets easier

## When should you use this?
1. You are using Google Sheets to take attendance for your class because it just happens to be that way.
2. You found out that looking up each person and writing "P" or "Present" is a bit annoying (especially on a phone).
3. You want to find out if there is a better way to do this without staying away from Google Sheets.

I met all 3 conditions above while being a TA for a class, so I built this out of frustration. Apparently, other TAs were also having the same problem and they loved this. It made me happy to know that this was useful to others, so I decided to make it public.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the app on development mode
